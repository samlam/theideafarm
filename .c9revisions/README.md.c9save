'git@github.com:/ajaxorg/node_chat')]` [Enter]\n  * Create new files inside your project\n  * Add them to to Git by executing the following command\n    `git add [file1, file2, file3, ...]` [Enter]\n  * Create a commit which can be pushed to the remote you just added\n    `git commit -m 'added new files'` [Enter]\n  * Push the commit the remote\n    `git push [remote name] master` [Enter]\n\nThat's it! If this doesn't work for you, please visit the excellent resources from [Github.com](http://help.github.com) and the [Pro Git](http://http://progit.org/book/) book.\nIf you can't find your answers there, feel free to ask us via Twitter (@cloud9ide), [mailing list](groups.google.com/group/cloud9-ide) or IRC (#cloud9ide on freenode).\n\nHappy coding!"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1029}]],"length":1029}
